## Installation

```
yarn add magicbin
```

## Usage

1. Create a `magicbin.config.js` file. Take example on [the demo one](/magicbin.config.js).
2. After each change, run `yarn mb sync` to apply the new configuration.
3. If you wish to access the logs, run `yarn mb open`.
4. To stop the local namespace, run `yarn mb stop`.
5. To fully stop the daemon itself, run `yarn mb daemon stop`.

## Advanced

### Daemon debug

For magicbin development or debug purposes, you can spawn its daemon as a regular process by running the following in a tab:

```
DEBUG='mb:*' CLIPANION_DAEMON=1 yarn mb
```

You'll then be able to run any command as usual from other terminals, which will execute inside the daemon you've spawned.

### Inter-process requirements

You can force a process to only start once another has started (and has been confirmed, if relevant, cf next section). To do that, just add a `dependsOn` field to your task definition.

### Process confirmation

Magicbin supports a non-standard protocol that lets processes notify the daemon that they have properly been setup. This is a good match for many kind of servers, which need to asynchronously go through various steps before being truly initialized.

To leverage that, the easiest way is to use the Magicbin Node API:

```ts
import {confirmProcess} from 'magicbin';

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end();
});

setTimeout(() => {
  server.listen(4500, () => {
    console.log(`Started to listen`);
    confirmProcess();
  });
}, 5000);
```
